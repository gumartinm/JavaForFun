/**
 * <p>
 * With this class we can run processes using the intended daemon which is 
 * waiting for TCP connections in a specified port.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Receiving the results from the daemon where we can find three kinds of 
 * different fields: stderror, stdout and the return value of the command which was
 * run by the remote daemon. Each field is related to the stderr, stdout and 
 * return code respectively.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class has to retrieve the results from the remote daemon and it offers two 
 * methods wich can be used to retrieve the stderr and stdout in a right way 
 * without having to know about the coding used by the daemon to send us the results. 
 * The user does not have to know about how the daemon sends the data, he or she 
 * will work directly with the strings related to each stream using these methods:
 * {@link TCPForkDaemon#getStdout()} and {@link TCPForkDaemon#getStderr()}.
 * The return code from the command executed by the daemon can be retrieved as the 
 * return parameter from the method {@link TCPForkDaemon#exec(String, String, int)}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are mutable. To use them concurrently, clients must surround each
 * method invocation (or invocation sequence) with external synchronization of the clients choosing.
