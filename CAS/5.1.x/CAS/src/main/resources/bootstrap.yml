# There is also a "native" profile in the Config Server that doesnâ€™t use Git, but just loads the config files from the local
# classpath or file system (any static URL you want to point to with "spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations").
# To use the native profile just launch the Config Server with "spring.profiles.active=native".
